## About Me
I am a US Navy veteran who is passionate about creating code that is efficient and elegant! I think functionality is great, but wouldn't it be better if it looked nice, too?
I love taking on new challenges, and I'm always up for an adventure! Maybe it's my love of books and games that I grew up with, and still keep with me to this day, but I can't say no to an opportunity to add another chapter to my story!

## Interests
- **Languages:**
  - C#
  - C++
  - Python
  - SQL
  
## Projects
- [Smart Task Tracker](https://github.com/AaronTigerLee/SmartTaskTracker): This application was created and designed using .NET MAUI, and is intended to draw data from a SQLite database utilizing a RESTful Web API. I wanted to explore full-stack development and learn how to integrate APIs into my applications. I thought that I might as well make something that helps me out with my daily life, too!
- [Task Tracker RESTful Web API](https://github.com/AaronTigerLee/TaskTrackerWebAPI): Here's the web API that was designed for my Smart Task Tracker app! It uses MVC architecture to enable future feature implementations, and allows for quick and easy Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions via the app.
